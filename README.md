## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
My app was not able to read other files.
I had the FATAL EXCEPTION error whcih made my program to not install on the emulator and I could not run it.
The classes I had to made caused me a huge challenge and a lot of errors. For example, for the loadMoreData method the sub classes I had to made gave me error to change things in another file and when I made changed, my other file faced some other issues.
I did all of the steps as the tutrial and thr biggest challenge was to change he files' names. In the tutorial only showed the names that has to be changed in the files not the manificant file.  This caused me FATAL EXCEPTION and made my app to not install.
